    This is useful for multi-label classification, where input samples can be
    classified as sets of labels. By only using accuracy (precision) a model
    would achieve a perfect score by simply assigning every class to every
    input. In order to avoid this, a metric should penalize incorrect class
    assignments as well (recall). The F-beta score (ranged from 0.0 to 1.0)
    computes this, as a weighted mean of the proportion of correct class
    assignments vs. the proportion of incorrect class assignments.

    With beta = 1, this is equivalent to a F-measure. With beta < 1, assigning
    correct classes becomes more important, and with beta > 1 the metric is
    instead weighted towards penalizing incorrect class assignments.
